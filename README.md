# Neural Networks for fish classification
The notebooks in this repository were made during the MO434 - Deep Learning course at IC Unicamp. The main problem to be solved was the identification of fish types in photos available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowww/a-large-scale-fish-dataset).
To do so, I trained, validated and tested convolutional neural networks with different architectures; compared with results from pre-trained NN, such as VGG and ResNet; tried an approach with contrastive learning; and used the [GradCam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391) method to understand the NN attention (for me, the coolest part of it).
The results with CNN aren't the best, but as I explain on the PDF, the dataset is not that large for training and that was one of the major problems.
